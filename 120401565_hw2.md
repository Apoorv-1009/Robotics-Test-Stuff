## Q 1.1 Composition of Transforms

In the given question it can be seen that we have rotations about the World frame and the Local frame. To understand how to perform rotations in these frames, assume a World frame $s$ and a Body frame $b$, related by the transformation matrix $T^{s}_{b}$. Such that any vector $X_b$ in frame $b$ can be expressed in frame $s$ as:
$X_s = T^{s}_{b} X_b$ <br>

When you transform the vector $X_s$ about an axis expressed in frame $s$, with a transformation matrix $T_s$, then its projection, $X^{'}_s$, can be written as
$$ X^{'}_{s} = T_s X_s = T_s T^{s}_{b} X_b$$ 
Hence, it can be seen that to do a transformation about an axis of the fixed frame $s$, a pre multiplication of the desired transformation matrix $T_s$ must be done.

Now, when we rotate the vector $X_b$ about the axis expressed in frame $b$, with a transformation matrix $T_b$, its projection, $X^{'}_{b}$ can be written as:
$$ X^{'}_{b} = T_b X_b$$ 
and,
$$ X^{'}_{s} = T^{s}_{b} X^{'}_{b}$$

Therefore, $X^{'}_{s} = T^{s}_{b} T_b X_b$

Thus we conclude that, to do a transformation about the body fixed frame $b$, a post multiplication of the desired transformation matrix $T_b$ must be done.

With these proofs in mind, we can now proceed to solve the mixed transforms as provided in the question.

In the given question, we use rotations about the z-axis and x-axis, which we know to be:

$$
Rot_{z}(\alpha) =
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\alpha) & -sin(\alpha) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\alpha) & cos(\alpha) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}

\quad

Rot_{x}(\alpha) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & cos(\alpha) & -sin(\alpha) & 0 \\
0 & sin(\alpha) & cos(\alpha) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Any translation, $T_{abc}$, where $a, b, c$ are the translations along the x, y and z axis respectively, can be expressed as:

$$
T_{x, y, z}(a, b, c) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & a \\
0 & 1 & 0 & b \\
0 & 0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Now we can consider the series of transforms step by step to update our transformation matrix.

Initially, we consider the World frame and the Local frame to be in the same frame. Thus we can initially write our Transformation matrix $H$, as:

 $$
H = I_{4\times4} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 1. Rotate by $\phi$ about the world z-axis
Since this rotation is about the world z-axis, we must pre-multiply the z-rotation matrix to the current Transformation matrix. We get our current transform as: 

$$
H = Rot_{z}(\phi) * H = 
Rot_{z}(\phi) =
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\phi) & -sin(\phi) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\phi) & cos(\phi) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 2. Translate by y along the current y-axis.
A translation of $y$ in the current y-axis would define our Translation matrix as:

$$
T_y(y) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & y \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This transformation is occuring about the current frame, and hence we must post-multiply the $T_y(y)$ transform, getting the resultant transform as:

$$
H = H * T_y(y) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\phi) & -sin(\phi) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\phi) & cos(\phi) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
*
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & y \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 3. Rotate by $\theta$ about the current z-axis.
Our rotation is about the current z-axis, thus we must post-multiply the z rotation matrix to our current Transformation matrix, to get: <br>

$$
H = H * Rot_{z}(\theta) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\phi) & -sin(\phi) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\phi) & cos(\phi) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
*
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & y \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
*
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 4. Rotate by $\psi$ about the world x-axis
Since this rotation is about the world x-axis, we must pre-multiply the x rotation matrix to get the desired Transformation matrix. Which we get as:

$$
H = Rot_{x}(\psi) * H =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & cos(\psi) & -sin(\psi) & 0 \\
0 & sin(\psi) & cos(\psi) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} 
*
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\phi) & -sin(\phi) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\phi) & cos(\phi) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
*
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & y \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
*
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

<br> <br>

To summmarise, to get the final rotation matrix, we do the following pre and post multiplications as per their order

$$
H = Rot_x(\psi) *([[Rot_z(\phi) * I_{4\times4}] *T_y(y)] * Rot_z(\theta))
$$

## Q 1.2 Modeling beyond rigid transformations
In the given question, we will make use of rotations about the z-axis and x-axis, which we know to be:

$$
Rot_{z}(\alpha) =
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\alpha) & -sin(\alpha) & 0 & 0\\
sin(\alpha) & cos(\alpha) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}

\quad

Rot_{x}(\alpha) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & cos(\alpha) & -sin(\alpha) & 0 \\
0 & sin(\alpha) & cos(\alpha) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Any translation, $T_{abc}$, where $a, b, c$ are the translations along the x, y and z axis respectively, can be expressed as:

$$
T_{x, y, z}(a, b, c) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & a \\
0 & 1 & 0 & b \\
0 & 0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let us make the following considerations about the earth and sun system: <br>
1. Consider a frame $F_1$ on the earth at time t=0, which is rotated about x-axis of the frame $F_f$ by -23.5 degrees.
2. Consider frame $F_2$, located at the sun, which is translated along the y-axis of $F_1$ by $a$, where $a$ is the largest distance between the sun and the earth. Thus it can be noticed that $F_1$ and $F2$ have the same orientation, and thus no rotational component in their transforms.
3. At any time t, consider a frame $F_3$, which coincides with the earth, with the same orientation as $F_2$. 
4. Consider a frame $F_4$, which is rotated about the x-axis of $F_3$ by 23.5 degrees.
5. From here it can be seen that the frame $F_e$ is a rotation about the z-axis of $F_4$. 

The frames above system can be visualized as:


<img src="../../Data/Frames.jpg" alt="Image" width="400" height="400">

<br>

Given our frames, it can be seen that to get the transformation matrix from $F_f$ to $F_e$, we can follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Frame $F_f$ to $F_1$
We know that the earth is 23.5 degrees tilted toward the sun, thus we must account for this rotation by first un-rotating our frame $F_f$, to align with the frame of the sun, i.e. $F_2$ <br>
$F_1$ was obtained by rotating along the x-axis of $F_f$ by -23.5 degrees, i.e. a rotation about the global frame, thus the transformation between them can be given as:

$$
F_1 = Rot_x(-23.5) * F_f = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & cos(-23.5) & -sin(-23.5) & 0 \\
0 & sin(-23.5) & cos(-23.5) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} 
$$

### Step 2: Frame $F_1$ to $F_2$
Translating along the y-axis of $F_1$ by $a$, we obtain frame $F_2$, i.e. a translation about the local frame is resulting in frame $F_2$, thus we get the transformation between them as:

$$
F_2 = F_1* T_y(-a) = F_1 * 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -a \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} 
$$

### Step 3: Frame $F_2$ to $F_3$
We know equation of the ellipse to be:
$$ x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1 \quad z = 0$$
The z = 0 ensures that the earth and the Sun are in the same plane of $F_2$, i.e. in the xy-plane. $a$ and $b$ are the maximum and minimum distances from the sun. 
In parametric form, we can express the ellipse in terms of $\tau$:
$$ x = a*cos(\tau) $$
$$ y = b*sin(\tau) $$
From the question, we can infer that: <br>
In 365 days we complete 1 revolution around the sun (360 degrees) <br>
In t days we complete (360/365 * t)th revolution around the sun <br>
Thus $\tau$ = 360/365 * t <br>
$F_3$ was defined such that it matches the orientation of $F_2$, with only a translation as the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. around $F_2$). Let us assume any time t, we would get the position of $F_3$ as:
$$ x^{'} = a*cos(360/365 * t) $$
$$ y^{'} = b*sin(360/365 * t) $$
Using astronomical data provided online, we can substitute $a$ = 1.01 au and $b$ = 0.98 au (1au = 1.496e+8 kilometers)<br>
Thus the transform from F_3 to F_2 can be defined as:

$$
F_2 = F_1* T_x, y(x^{'}, y^{'}) = F_1 * 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & x^{'} \\
0 & 1 & 0 & y^{'} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
= F_1 * 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1.01*cos(360/365 * t) \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0.98*sin(360/365 * t) \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} 
$$

### Step 4: Frame $F_3$ to $F_4$
Since in Step 1, we un-rotated the frame $F_f$ to align with $F_2$, we must now rotate it back to align the z-axis correctly with the $F_e$ frames z-axis. <br>
$F_4$ is defined as a 23.5 degree rotation about the x-axis of $F_3$. Thus its transformation can be given as:

$$
F_4 = F_3 * Rot_x(23.5) = F_3 * \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & cos(23.5) & -sin(23.5) & 0 \\
0 & sin(23.5) & cos(23.5) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Step 5: Frame $F_4$ to $F_e$
For this final step, we must rotate $F_4$ about its z-axis to get the earths orientation at time t. This rotation accounts for the day revolution. We can infer that: <br>
In 1 day, we complete 1 rotation (360 degrees) <br>
In t days, we complete 1 * t rotations (360 * t degrees) <br>
With this information, we can write the final transformation as:

$$
F_e = F_4 * Rot_{z}(360 * t) = 
F_4 *
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(360 * t) & -sin(360 * t) & 0 & 0\\
sin(360 * t) & cos(360 * t) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
And thus we get the orientation of  $F_e$ in terms of $F_f$

### Final Transformation Matrix
Given our series of transforms, we can summarize and write the final transformation matrix, $H(t)$, as:
$$
H(t) = [[[[[I_{4\times4}*Rot_x(-23.5)]*T_y(-a)]*T_{x, y}(1.01*cos(360/365 * t), 0.98*sin(360/365 * t))]*Rot_x(23.5)]Rot_z(360*t)]
$$
Where t is in days.

## Q 1.3 Transform Estimation

To get the desired orientation from the given configuration, we can perform the following set of transforms: <br>
1. Rotate the cube 180 degrees about the Y axis
2. Translate the cube 0.5m along the Z axis
3. Translate the cube 0.5m along the X axis
Our cube is now oriented such that the Y axis passes through the centre cube and 
4. Rotate the cube 45 degrees about the Y axis
5. Translate the cube 1/sq.root(2)m along the Z axis
Now your point G is on the Y axis
6. Translate the cube 1/sq.root(2)m along the X axis
7. Translate the cube -1m along the Y axis
Your cube has the plane EFGH on the XZ Plane, with F and G on the Z and X axis respectively

The final orientation can be seen as:

## Q 2.1 Trajectory Optimization
For the given problem, we are given:
1. Final orientation: ψg = 45◦, θg = 25◦, φg = 16◦
2. ωmax = 2 deg/s
3. |ωx|, |ωy |, |ωz | ≤ ωmax

To get to the desired orientation in the shortest amount of time, we apply the maximum angular velocity (ωmax) to each axis. Since we can vary the angular velocity freely, we can apply the maximum velocity till we reach the desired orientation


```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize variables
psi, theta, phi = 0, 0, 0  # Initial orientations
psi_g, theta_g, phi_g = 45, 25, 16  # Final orientations
wx, wy, wz = 2, 2, 2  # Angular velocities

time_step = 0.1
time = [0]  # Start at time t=0
psi_data, theta_data, phi_data = [psi], [theta], [phi]

# Simulate the orientation changes over time
while psi < psi_g or theta < theta_g or phi < phi_g:
    # Limit angular velocities once the final orientations are reached
    if psi >= psi_g:
        wx = 0
    if theta >= theta_g:
        wy = 0
    if phi >= phi_g:
        wz = 0

    # Update angles and time
    psi += wx * time_step
    theta += wy * time_step
    phi += wz * time_step
    time.append(time[-1] + time_step)

    # Store angle data
    psi_data.append(psi)
    theta_data.append(theta)
    phi_data.append(phi)

# Plot the data
plt.plot(time, psi_data, label='Psi')
plt.plot(time, phi_data, label='Phi')
plt.plot(time, theta_data, label='Theta')
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Angle (degrees)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```
The final plot is:
